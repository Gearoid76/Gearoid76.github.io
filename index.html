                                <h2>Profile</h2>
								<p>My assets are co-working skills, understanding of user experiences and willingness to always learn more. My work experience from the Electronics and Hospitality industry have thought me good project management skills, communicate skills and ability to adapt.</p>
								<p>	Currently I am in the process of finishing my bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Technology, obtained in Finland. Therefore, I am looking for inspiring new challenges in related to IT business and user experience. For example, I am eager to learn more on design (Webdesign, 3D design) and its connections to cyber security.

                                <div>Some notes on these projects:</div>
				    				<p>These are some of the projects that I've been working on, as a part of a team or by myself. Some are design based and others are based on backend. <p>
								<p><b>Thesis</b> I wrote my thesis titled <i>Timed Delay Data Management in Salesforce</i>, I wrote this thinking how I could change the govenor limits, in order to let people work faster.</p>
								<p><b>Pia </b>Is an example of a team based project in<b> Digital design</b>  were we where asked to create a timetable which would go onto an existing platform already established in the school.</p>
								<p><b>Wordpress blogs </b> These were for a Linux course. After which I promptly switched from Windows. But, that was short lived as many of the programs I used in various courses couldn't be transferred to Linux. So now I'm using a dual-boot pc. Swapping between the two. whilst windows is my stronger suit (at the moment), I would like go 100% Linux. I'm currently transferring to linux or unix.
								At time of writing Bionic Beaver from Ubuntu.</p>
								<p><b>Blender </b> This was my way to discover how to design by using Blender. </p>
								<p><b>Unity </b> This was a natural step from blender seeing how the 3d world interacts with each other. </p>
