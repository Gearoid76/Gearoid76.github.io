								<p>My assets are co-working skills, understanding of user experiences and willingness to always learn more. My work experience from the Electronics and Hospitality industry have thought me good project management skills, communicate skills and ability to adapt.</p>
								<p>	Currently I have finished my bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Technology, obtained in Finland. Therefore, I am looking for inspiring new challenges related to IT, and user experience. For example, I am eager to learn more on design (Webdesign, 3D design) and its connections to cyber security.

								<div>Some notes on these projects:</div>
								<p><p>These are some of the projects that I've been working on, as a part of a team. Some are design based and others are based on backend. <p></p>
				    			<p>Whilst others, I got interested in becouse I like gaming, How games work, How easy we learn from them, and by design they teach us. <p>
								<p><b>Thesis</b> I wrote my thesis titled <i>Timed Delay Data Management in Salesforce</i>, I wrote this thinking how I could change the govenor limits, in order to let people work faster.</p>
								<p><b>Wordpress blogs </b> These were for a Linux course. After which I promptly switched from Windows. But, that was short lived as many of the programs I used in various courses couldn't be transferred to Linux. So now I'm using a dual-boot pc. Swapping between the two. whilst windows is my stronger suit (at the moment), I would like go 100% Linux. I'm currently transferring to linux or unix.
								At time of writing Bionic Beaver from Ubuntu.</p>
								<p><b>Blender </b> This was my way to discover how to design by using Blender. </p>
								<p><b>Unity </b> This was a natural step from blender seeing how the 3d world interacts with each other. </p>

					<h2>Portfolio</h2>
					<p>Having done Digital design, as a minor, I realised that games/websites were created in the same way (or should be). Using the same methodologies is the same for every project. </p>
					<p>I know that, as we were doing these projects we were still learning about the various steps in U.X. and in U.I. we skipped some steps, or found that some steps were more important than others, We did learn from it Asking the questions "who is it for?","what ages, and how will it be used?" 
						using the white board and markers to create a flow from each page, We were more concerned about creating a flow and ease of the site than actual users (which were students)
						for pia and children for the Enviormental game.  </p>

					<p><b>Pia</b> A program that would allow the students of Haaga-Helia to intregrate their classrooms into a responsive calendar, allowing them to be more productive. </p>
					<p>Pia Is an example of a team based project in<b> Digital design</b>  were we where asked to create an app which would go onto an existing platform already established in the school.</p>
					<a href="https://gearoid76.github.io/Gearoid76.github.io/Index_Portfolio.html" target="_blank"><img class="img-responsive" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1KQcac0wnG89lXoSM6R3SYqJpKZkcXmwb" alt="Enviormental Game"  class="img-rounded" alt="Enviormental game" width="100" height="100" class="float-right"></a>
					<p>	 <b>The Enviormental game </b> that was created but not finished, We as a team were tasked with ideas on how to educate primary school children, whilst making it fun. </p>

					<p>	 This was another team effort, this is the first game that I was involved in, I was at the time in the marketing side so all drawings come from the 3D-Artists involved.  
					<p> I know that, as we were doing these we were still learning about the various steps in U.X. and in U.I. We did learn from it Asking the questions "who is it for?","what ages, and how will it be used?" bypassing paper prototyping (Which were paperpostits, but more of a storyboard) and creating personas and scenarios or having any user Data to get information from. Project Pristine was a weekend event, to come up with an idea and implement it, Then to copare and contend with other groups
