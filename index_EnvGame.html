        <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p class="lead">This is a plan of an application, on a mobile device, which can be used in schools to educate primary school children in the advantages of recycling. 
          This was a part of our course in Haaga-Helia. We were coorperating with a Swedish primary school to come up with an idea on how to educate children and make it fun to recycle in the process. 
          Here is what we came up with. </p>
          <p class="lead">Working with the teacher, we passed on information and ideas on how her students (aged between 11-13) would like. she asked her and her students to give feedback.  </p>
          <p class="lead">Problem - Creating an app that creates picking up rubbish and recycling fun.</p>

<h2>Interviews</h2>         
<p class="lead">Since we couldn't talk to the students directly we had an intermediatary. The teacher, who passed on relevent information to us. We did some drawing or ideas they came back with a yey/ney this was done on a weekly basis. Sending emails back every week (Thursday) meeting via skype every Monday to coordinate. </p>
<h2>Low resolution/paper prototyping</h2>         
<p class="lead"> I did the first four sketches, Thanks to Paula (artist) for letting me use the rest of her sketches. Tim (editor and chief) Toby and I were working on the story board along with ideas on how it should look. </p>

<h2>Story Board </h2>
  <p class="lead">STORY: 2125: The world has become a jungle again, the third "elemental war" has either exiled the upper classes to Earth 2.0, left the lower classes, soldiers and criminals to die here. What they didn't expect is that Earth as become an Eden once more, But there are dangers. Animals that are still suffering from the illeffects of the rubbish left behind. Choking them. Causing them pain. 
          Turning them into monsters. With your help we can change this into an eden for all walks of life. As you save and recycle the rubbish, helping the animals they intern will help you.  </p>
<h2>Creating personas</h2>
    <p class="lead">Our customers were students. From the ages of 6 - 10. Who would hopefully play this game. As a group or solo. Hopefully with the involvment of the teacher, who also has an (admin) account the teacher could give credits to the students for recycling etc. </p>
    <p class="lead">(Side game) Credit could also be collected from adults who could encourage children to collect and recycle rubbish for points. </p>

<h2>End of project / feedback </h2>
  <p class="lead"> It only got as far as the ideation phase of the UX as the project was probably passed onto other students. But working with a client was a wonderful source of information. </p>
